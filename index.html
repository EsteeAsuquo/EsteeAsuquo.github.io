    <div class="card">
      <p>Antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health due to their resilience against treatment and high transmission rates in environments such as hospitals and communities. We present an Agent-Based Model (ABM) for simulating the dynamics and spread of bacterial populations in hospitals. We will be focusing on three gram-negative bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The NetLogo simulation will provide an understanding on bacterial growth, modeling transmission routes, studying antibiotic resistance, examine effects of antibiotic application and cleanliness interventions, and explore how quorum sensing impacts bacterial behavior. By collecting data on these bacteria, we can determine which interventions are most effective in prohibiting the transmission and spread of the bacteria.  </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p> Gram-negative bacteria and their species– Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause bacterial infections. These bacteria are among the world's most significant public health problems due to their high resistance to antibiotics. Enterobacteriaceae are bacilli, non-sporulated, have variable motility, grow in the presence and absence of oxygen, ferment organisms of glucose, are cytochrome oxidase negative, and can reduce nitrate to nitrite. The non-fermenter, gram-negative bacilli (BNF) have a lower frequency of isolation when compared to Enterobacteriaceae yet are relevant because of their ability to induce severe or fatal infections, especially in hospital environments. The main BNF microorganisms that cause these diseases are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii. These microorganisms spread through hospitals via airways, contaminated surfaces, and patient to patient interaction, and are considered nosocomial pathogens because of their healthcare-associated infections (HAI’s) that complicate patient recovery. Due to the nature of these bacteria, and their immunity to most common antibiotics, it is imperative that we assess the biological cost to determine the stability and potential reversibility of resistance as a potential solution. These bacteria also could communicate through a process called quorum-sensing, which allow colonies to detect their population density through the release and sensing of signaling molecules, or autoinducers, that allow the bacteria to coordinate collective behaviors such as biofilm and virulence. They can cause foodborne illnesses, and also infect patients in the hospital, bringing harmful diseases to humans, plants, and animals. These bacteria are extremely resistant to standard antibiotics and our immune system, which makes them difficult to control, leading to fierce outbreaks and a rise in the number of deaths, especially amongst the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. 

      Agent-based modeling (ABM) allows for a detailed and intensive study and analysis of the different bacteria transmission and impact. Agent-based modeling is the computational model approach to simulate interactions between individual agents in a defined environment. Each agent has their own characteristics, behaviors, and decision-making capabilities. The difference between conventional statistical models and ABMs is that the latter can be used to simulate interactions between agents, the environment, and different pathways. This helps in the identification of high-risk areas, prediction of outbreaks, and evaluation of the effectiveness of various interventional modalities including the use of quarantining and antibiotics.  

      The primary objective of this project is to utilize ABMs to aid public health strategies in reducing the spread of gram-negative bacterial infections. By using ABMs, we are hoping to get incremental outcomes that can be used in suggesting healthier policies and protective measures concerning gram-negative bacteria in communities.  

      This work is organized as follows: This section presents the problem and the objectives of the present research. Section 2 will provide the related works that will give context to this study. Section 3 will describe the methods used to develop the ABM’s framework and the core components used for this study, and Section 4 will discuss preliminary results along with future research proposals. </p>

      <p>Modeling bacterial or viral infections via NetLogo is something that is not new to the field [4][5][6]. However, modeling these 3 specific gram-negative bacteria has not been done yet to the best of our knowledge. There are several other studies that align with our goals and provide a good framework for what we are trying to accomplish, such as.. </p>

    <h2>Model Overview</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>The ABM will be designed to capture bacterial transmission among a population. Key characteristics of the model will include:  

 Agent Characteristics: Each agent will represent an individual with specific attributes such as age, health status, and behavior patterns (hygiene and social interactions). These attributes will allow the model to represent a more realistic simulation of how different demographics respond to infections and interventions. We will have two classifications of agents, one being humans (patients, nurses, cleaners) and one being bacteria (one of the three types). Each agent will have their own characteristics and variables, which can be found in the next section titled 3.2 Core components. There you will find the complete list of variables for both types of agents, along with variable-types and descriptions that will explain what each variable does. 

Environment Characteristics: The model will simulate numerous environments where transmission can occur, such as hospitals. The environment will have distinct characteristics, such as having patches that will simulate different parts of the hospital. Patches will have their own variables showing contamination or sanitation, and patch color to show whether or not the patch is contaminated. The environment will also be put on a cleaning frequency slider that will determine how often a random patch is cleaned. We will also track the effectiveness of each clean based on a scale from 0.0-1.0, where 0.0 means the clean was not very effective and 1.0 means the clean was extremely effective. These are also variables that are elaborated under section 3.2 Core components. 

Transmission Pathways: The model will incorporate multiple transmission pathways, including direct contact, airborne transmission, and surface contamination. This will enable the exploration of how different means of transmission contribute to the spread of bacteria over patches and humans. Each pathway will have a specific chance of contaminating a patch or infecting a human based on which type of bacteria it is classified as, and whether or not the bacteria agent interacted with another patch or the human agent. 

Intervention Strategies: The model will implement different public health interventions, such as patch sanitation, quarantining, and special antibiotics. The model will be able to adjust parameters to simulate the impact of these strategies on infection rates and outbreak dynamics. 

Simulation Scenarios: We will run simulations under different scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. For example, we may simulate a sudden “outbreak” in a hospital setting and assess how different parameters from multiple characteristics react to conclude which characteristics are more important than others in reducing transmission. </p>
    <p>The simulation begins with a time-step set to zero, and all relevant global variables or data, such as the total number of bacteria, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and susceptible bacteria, are initialized. A hospital environment is then constructed as a grid of patches, each representing a part of the hospital. These patches are initialized with default attributes: they are not contaminated, have a contamination duration of zero, are not cleaned, and are colored white to indicate a clean state. 

Once the environment is set, the model generates agents. Bacterial agents are created with specific characteristics including species, whether they are resistant to antibiotics, growth and death rates, mutation rates, age, and quorum-sensing levels. Human agents, which include patients, nurses, and cleaners, are also initialized. These human agents have attributes such as hygiene behavior, movement patterns, infection status, infection duration, contact rate, and sensitivity to antibiotics. 

The core of the simulation runs in a continuous time-step loop. In each cycle, the time step is incremented. For each bacterium, the model simulates aging by increasing its age. If the bacterium exceeds its maximum age or meets a probabilistic death threshold, it is removed. If the growth conditions are favorable, that is, the local quorum sensing level exceeds a threshold and growth rate increases, the bacterium reproduces, and the offspring may mutate. Each bacterium then moves to an adjacent patch, and that patch becomes contaminated or remains contaminated if the patch was not clean, and the contamination duration increases by one. 

Human agents act according to their roles. They move based on their defined movement patterns. When they encounter a contaminated patch, the model evaluates the chance of infection, influenced by the agent's contact rate, hygiene behavior, and the bacterial species. If infection occurs, the agent’s infection status is updated, and their infection duration starts to increase. Infected humans may also contribute to spreading the bacteria to nearby patches or other agents. 

Interventions are an essential part of the simulation. At user-defined intervals, cleaning events occur. The model selects patches, either randomized or targeted, and attempts to clean them. If cleaning is successful, the patch is marked as cleaned, its contaminated status is removed, and patch-color returns to white. However, if the cleaning is not entirely effective, some bacteria may remain, the patch stays contaminated, and its color may reflect a partially clean state. In such cases, the contamination duration continues to increase. Additionally, persistent contamination after a cleaning attempt can trigger antibiotic intervention. For example, if a patch has been cleaned but remains contaminated, the model can automatically activate antibiotics to address unresolved bacterial presence. This approach reflects real-world healthcare practices, where persistent contamination after environmental cleaning may necessitate chemical or antibiotic escalation to prevent further spread and resistance. 

Antibiotic interventions are governed by a predefined schedule. When antibiotics are active, each bacterium is evaluated. Non-resistant bacteria have a high probability of dying, while resistant ones survive. If antibiotics are not applied, bacteria continue to live or die based on their natural death rate without any additional external pressure. 

Throughout the simulation, data is collected and monitored. Metrics such as total bacteria count, resistant and susceptible populations, the number of contaminated patches, infection durations, and the frequency and effectiveness of interventions are logged at each timestep.  </p>

    <h2>Expected Results</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>The expected outcomes of this project include insights into transmission pathways, evaluation of intervention strategies, and a contribution to the medical field. The model will provide valuable insights on how antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria spread within different environments. By identifying high-risk areas and transmission pathways, public health officials can better target preventative intervention strategies. The simulations we create will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of public health strategies in controlling bacterial infections. This will help persuade policy decisions and resource allocation, leading to more effective management of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The findings from the model will contribute to the development of data-driven recommendations for public health authorities. These recommendations may include guidelines for infection control practices, vaccination strategies, and public awareness campaigns. By utilizing agent-based modeling, this project aims to provide valuable data on the current understanding of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. In the future, we would like to….. </p>
