            <p><strong>Title:</strong> BacteriaSim</p>
            <p><strong>Author(s):</strong> David Barry and Esther Asuquo</p>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 8, 2025</p>
            <p><strong>Advisor:</strong> Professor Eric Araujo</p>

            <h3>Background and Problem</h3>
            <p>Antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria and their species – Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa – can cause bacterial infections that pose a threat to public health. These bacteria can cause foodborne illnesses, infect patients in hospitals, and bring many harmful diseases to humans, plants, and animals. They are stronger than antibiotics and, in some cases, the immune system, which makes them more difficult to control, leading to fierce outbreaks and a rise in the number of deaths, especially among the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.</p>
            <p>The method of agent-based modeling (ABM) is provided for a detailed and intensive study and analysis of the different bacteria's transmission and impact. Unlike conventional statistical models, ABM can simulate interactions between individuals, the environment, and different routes or mechanisms through which bacteria are transmitted from one host or surface to another. This helps identify high-risk areas, predict outbreaks, and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions, including quarantine and antibiotic strategies.</p>

            <p>The primary objective of this project is to utilize ABM to aid public health strategies in reducing the spread of these gram-negative bacterial infections. Through the use of technology and data-driven understanding of possible solutions, we hope to produce actionable results that can inform policy and protective measures concerning these gram-negative bacteria in communities.</p>

            <h3>Brief Description of Solution Being Provided</h3>
            <p>We will develop an agent-based model using NetLogo to simulate and capture bacterial transmission among a population. Key characteristics of the model will include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Agent Characteristics:</strong> Each agent will represent an individual with attributes such as age, health status, and behavior patterns (hygiene and social interactions). These attributes will allow the model to represent a more realistic simulation of how different demographics respond to infections and interventions.</li>
              <li><strong>Environment Characteristics:</strong> The model will simulate several environments where transmission can occur, including hospitals, communities, and food production areas. Each environment will have distinct characteristics—population density, sanitation levels, and access to healthcare—which influence transmission and recovery rates.</li>
              <li><strong>Transmission Pathways:</strong> The model will incorporate multiple transmission pathways, including direct contact, airborne transmission, and surface contamination. This will enable exploration of how different modes of transmission contribute to spread.</li>
              <li><strong>Intervention Strategies:</strong> The model will implement different public health interventions—enhanced sanitation, quarantining, and antibiotics—and offer parameter adjustments to simulate their impact on infection rates and outbreak dynamics.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Simulation Scenarios:</strong> We will run simulations under different scenarios to evaluate intervention effectiveness. For example, we may simulate a sudden outbreak in a hospital setting and assess how parameter changes affect transmission and identify which characteristics are most important in reducing spread.</p>

            <p>The expected outcomes include insights into transmission pathways, evaluation of intervention strategies, data-driven recommendations, and a contribution to the broader field. The model will provide valuable information on how antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria spread within different environments. By identifying high-risk areas and transmission pathways, public health officials can better target preventive strategies. The simulations will allow evaluation of public health strategies to support policy and resource allocation decisions.</p>

            <h3>Research or Development Objective</h3>
            <p>Our simulation will be built using NetLogo, an agent-based modeling platform that creates the conditions necessary to replicate population dynamics across locations like hospitals, households, and food markets. The model will represent multiple transmission paths—direct contact, airborne particles, and contaminated surfaces—with varying probabilities and environmental characteristics.</p>

            <p>The literature review will involve analyzing existing research on bacterial transmission, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and public health interventions. Sources will include academic journals and case studies from institutions such as the CDC and WHO to help refine model parameters like infection probabilities, incubation periods, and treatment effectiveness.</p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <ul>

              <li>Model completed by August 18, 2025</li>
              <li>Implementation of the Agent-Based Model completed by October 18, 2025</li>
              <li>Domain Expert Test completed by November 15, 2025</li>
              <li>Final Agent-Based Model completed by December 1, 2025</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Interest and Qualifications</h3>
            <p>We are deeply interested in the intersection of public health and computer science, particularly using technology to address real-world challenges affecting vulnerable populations. The threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria demands innovative, data-driven solutions. This project allows us to apply technical skills to model and better understand bacterial transmission dynamics.</p>

            <p>Both authors have completed coursework in software development, data structures, and algorithms, equipping them with the foundational skills for building ABMs. Esther has a background in statistical analysis and interest in healthcare applications, while David has experience with NetLogo and complex systems modeling. Together, they will dedicate at least 6–8 hours per week during the semester, with additional time over the summer and fall to maintain project momentum.</p>

            <h3>Collaboration with Advisor, Outside Experts, and Users</h3>
            <p>We are working under the guidance of Professor Eric Araujo and plan weekly meetings. We will also collaborate with domain experts (John Wetrz and Dani McBride) to validate assumptions and refine the model based on their experience.</p>
